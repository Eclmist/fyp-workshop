#+TITLE: FYP preparation workshop
#+AUTHOR: Jing Yen Loh, Chua Bing Quan, Joshua Yap

This contains the materials for my Final Year Project preparation workshop. This
was designed for my FYP team but hopefully will be of use to other interested
groups as well.

* Topic considerations
  Topics were selected with the following considerations in mind:
  - applicable to FYP
  - Useful to average attendee
  - Equip attendee with fundamentals to explore and learn further by themselves
  
  Therefore, specific frameworks (e.g. React, Vue, Express etc.) are
  intentionally ommitted. Instead, this workshop aims to cover the
  fundamentals necessary for attendees to easily pick up such frameworks simply
  by reading the documentation.
  
  Please do propose new topics if you feel they are relevant based on personal
  experience.
