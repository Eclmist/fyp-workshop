# Introduction<a id="sec-1"></a>

The aim of this workshop is to introduce key concepts and benefits of a programming language.

# JavaScript<a id="sec-2"></a>

## Equality<a id="sec-2-1"></a>

### Problem<a id="sec-2-1-1"></a>

What do you think is gonna happen below?

```js
return 1 == 1;
```

What about this?

```js
return 1 === 1;
```

ðŸ˜² So what's the difference ??!?!?

Well, let's try this&#x2026;

```js
return 1 == "1";
```

**Huh?**

```js
return 1 == [1];
```

**!!!**

```js
return 1 == true; // wat
```

    true

Ok, ok, we get the point. Why does this happen?

In JavaScript, `==` is the _abstract equality operator_. When comparing values
with `==`, it converts both values to a common type. As an example, with
[5](#org793ab51), it converts the `true` to a number before comparing.

```js
return Number(true);
```

So since 1 is equal to 1, `1 == true` evaluates to true.

### Solution<a id="sec-2-1-2"></a>

`===` is the strict equality operator. If the values are of different types, they're unequal.

```js
console.log(1 === "1");
console.log(1 === [1]);
console.log(1 === true);
return undefined === null;
```

Well, most of the time anyway. You still get magical edge cases like this.

```js
return NaN === NaN;
```

TLDR; with JavaScript, **ALWAYS** use the strict equality operator (`===`) for
comparison unless you really know what you're doing with `==`.

## Arrow Functions<a id="sec-2-2"></a>

Consider the following function:

```js
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}
```

* [ ] Something about anonymous

Arrow functions were influenced by CoffeeScript, a functional programming language that transpiled into JavaScript.

They make simple functions a lot more concise.

```js
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
```

The difference is particularly apparent when they're passed as arguments e.g. in Promise chains.

```js
fetch("www.example.com/api/v3")
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(function(json) {
    console.log(json);
  });

/* Versus */
fetch("www.example.com/api/v3")
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(json => console.log(json));
```

But surely they weren't added just for a little syntactic sugar?

## "Classes"<a id="sec-2-3"></a>

Classes in Javascript was first introduced in ECMAScriptÂ® 2015. They are essentially **syntactical sugar**
over Javascript's inheritance with prototype chaining. A reason why you would consider using ES6 Classes
is almostly due to cleaner and simpler syntax. Will there be performance differences (In a positive note)?
Probably the ECMAScript engine rendering the Javascript codes will be able to optimize a little better but 
there will probably be little to no significant difference in the way the script performs. Another reason 
why you should Classes is due to the fact that it is much easier to set up inheritance using the new ES6
syntax.

## Promises<a id="sec-2-4"></a>

## Generic tooling<a id="sec-2-5"></a>

### ESLint<a id="sec-2-5-1"></a>

Fundamentally, ESLint is a utility that enforces a collection of rules (a style
guide) that your JS code needs to adhere to. By enforcing these set of rules,
ESLint is able to catch errors that you might have failed to notice when writing
JS (e.g. a dangling comma, syntax errors, accidental globals).

ESLint further enforces code formatting conventions, prompting you to write code
in a uniform fashion that can be easily understood and maintained by your team.

Moreover, ESLint is plugin based, and hence, different kinds of style guides can
be configured for your project to catch JS errors and enforce formatting
conventions.

Here's a quick look of ESLint in action in Visual Studio Code:

To sum up, ESLint is a utility implemeted in JS projects to ensure that the code
you write meets the rules it enforces, so as to keep your code base consistent
and as error free as possbile.
